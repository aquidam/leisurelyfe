Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the same person behind New York's Central Park, Mount Royal Park boasts miles of trails and superb views of the city. Here, you can stroll down the tree-lined paths and recharge with a picnic on the grass by Beaver Lake. You can also enjoy outdoor activities year-round, such as canoeing in the summer and skiing in the wintertime. There’s a mild climb to reach the viewing area at the top. Alternatively, you can hop on a public bus to reach the peak. – Tripadvisor",

Situated to the northwest of what is now Downtown Montréal, the neighborhood is defined by its Victorian mansions, noteworthy institutions, elegant stores, grand avenues, green spaces and monuments that call back to its early years when its residents represented nearly 70 percent of the wealth of Canada. The Square Mile is part of the Mount Royal natural and historical district and includes McGill University, the McCord Museum of Canadian History, the Montréal Museum of Fine Arts and many other attractions and landmarks to be discovered while strolling along Sherbrooke Street West. The term “golden” was added to the name in the 1950s by real estate developers to refer to the prosperity of the area. Originally spanning about one square mile, it is contained by a southern border of René Lévesque (formerly Dorchester Street), Mount Royal Park",

It was created in 2006 by Tarek Ben Ghorbal, a young tunisian who came to study in Quebec in 2003. Having been born in a family of craftsmen and grown in the souks of the medina of Tunis and after having finished his master's in finance from the University of Sherbrooke, he then decides to reproduce the atmosphere of the souk in a Moroccan and Tunisian shop in Montreal which bears his name . Indeed, the word medina is used in the Maghreb countries to indicate the old neighbourhood of the city. A magic place where all the craftsmen and the small business owners meet to form souks specialized in leather craft, pottery, fabcric, hammered copper, traditional clothes, carpets, babouche slippers and oriental decoration.",
